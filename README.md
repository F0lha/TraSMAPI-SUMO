# TraSMAPI-SUMO

This is a [TraSMAPI](https://github.com/STEMS-group/trasmapi) specialisation for [SUMO simulator](http://www.sumo-sim.org).

**TraSMAPI** is a generic API used as bridge for microscopic traffic simulators [(what is a microscopic simulator?)](https://github.com/STEMS-group/trasmapi/wiki/Simulation-Models) that allows real-time communication between agents in the urban traffic context (such as vehicles, traffic lights and pedestrians) and the environment created by  various simulators. This tool was developed at LIACC (Artificial Intelligence and Computer Science Laboratory), University of Porto.

**SUMO** is an open-source program (licenced under GPL) for microscopic traffic simulation. It is mainly developed by Institute of Transportation Systems, located at German Aerospace Center.
